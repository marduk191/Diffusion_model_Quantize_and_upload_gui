# Model Quantizer & Uploader GUI Requirements
# Core Python GUI library (usually included with Python)
# tkinter - Built into Python standard library

# Hugging Face utilities for model upload/download
huggingface_hub>=0.16.0

# Path manipulation and file operations (built into Python 3.4+)
# pathlib - Built into Python standard library

# Process management and system operations (built into Python)
# subprocess - Built into Python standard library

# Threading support (built into Python)
# threading - Built into Python standard library

# Operating system interface (built into Python)
# os - Built into Python standard library

# System-specific parameters and functions (built into Python)
# sys - Built into Python standard library

# Optional: Enhanced file dialog support
# Note: tkinter.filedialog is part of tkinter, no separate install needed

# Development and testing dependencies (optional)
# pytest>=7.0.0
# black>=22.0.0
# flake8>=4.0.0

# Note: This application primarily uses Python standard library modules.
# The main external dependency is huggingface_hub for uploading models.
# 
# Additional tools required (not Python packages):
# - llama-quantize.exe (from llama.cpp project)
# - convert.py (custom conversion script)
# - convert_fp8_scaled_stochastic.py (custom FP8 conversion script)
#
# System requirements:
# - Python 3.7+
# - Windows OS (for llama-quantize.exe)
# - Sufficient RAM for model processing
# - Disk space for quantized model outputs
